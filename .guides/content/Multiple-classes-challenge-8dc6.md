### Hint

If you can't pass the challenge :

1) Go to the previous sections and be sure to understand why and how we separated a css class `.box-red-left` into 3 different classes `.box`, `.red` and `.left` and what css properties goes into each of those classes.

2) If you still can't make it analyse the class names on the left, for example : 
`.normal-orange-center` and think how it should be split into 3 classes like `.normal` , `.orange`, `.center` and then don't forget to also change the `index.html` file to reflect the changes you made into the css.
