### A little side note on how to layout your css rules

As you have seen in the previous css code, you can either write your rule on 1 line or on many lines. 

For example you can write :

```css
.green { color:#069625; background-color:#a7e2a5; border-color:#069625; }
```

Or : 

```css
.green { 
  color:#069625; 
  background-color:#a7e2a5; 
  border-color:#069625; 
}
```

The second option is recommended, simply because it is more readable.

It is acceptable to put a css rule on one line only when there is only one property in it, like this :

```css
.left { text-align:left; }
```

Any of these techniques will give the same result in the browser, but it is recommended to use the most readable way !
