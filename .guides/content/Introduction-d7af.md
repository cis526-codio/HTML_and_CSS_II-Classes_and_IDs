### In the previous units
We have seen the general structure of an html document, we have seen many tags allowing us to structure our content inside the document and we have seen some basic CSS allowing us to style this structured content.

### In this unit
We will see how to use the full power of css using css classes and ids. Indeed we learned how to apply some css style to html tags and that is already very useful, but what happends if we want to reuse style on different elements or if we want the same element to look different depending on where/how we use it.

That's what we will see in this unit !
