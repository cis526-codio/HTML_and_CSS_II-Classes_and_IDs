  <p>Up until now, you had two ways of saving; Auto and Manual. Saving automatically was and still is the default mode, while Manual save was a simple option you could turn on and off at any time.</p>
  <p class="quote">Way back when Codio was just a baby, we only had Auto Save. Saving automatically is a huge time saver in terms of productivity, simply because you do not have to take any action to save your changes. This works great for most use cases, however it soon became apparent that in some use cases, Auto save was creating more problems than it solved, so we introduced Manual Save.</p>
  <p>One example of this, is when you use any kind of automatic reload. There are tools that can watch your files for changes, and then automatically reload the preview, thus avoiding the need for you to manually reload the page you made changes to. This is great, but quickly becomes unusable while using auto save. This is because Auto save applies changes to the file on every key stroke, which in this case, would mean that your preview would be reloaded on each of those keystrokes.</p>
